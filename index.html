	<h1>My Autobiography</h1>
	<hr/>
	<p>My name is Ina Rose Bondoc, my friends usually call me Rose or Drew, 20 years of age. My mother came up with the name 'Rose'</br>
		because the day I was born my cheeks are glowing red. My elementary friends started calling me 'Drew' when I punched someone in the face back in the day. </br>
		That's my first ever fist fight that drew blood. I'm not a trouble maker nor a bully. The guy deserved it for bullying another kid.</br>
		I was born in a family with four other siblings and I am one of the three girls. I am the second eldest among my siblings. <br/>
		Also, they said my name doesn't suit my personality</br>
		I'm a freshman in college and I'm taking Computer Science. I will be shifting course next school year from comscie to educ<br/>
		I'm currently living with my mom here in Capas,Tarlac. She's working as a call center agent and my father is from Zambales and he's managing his resort.<br/>
		I grew up with my mom and my step father</p>
		
		<p>There are things I love doing during my free time and also helps me cope like: read books, <br>
		write stories and poems, play my guitar, sing and watch documentaries.<br/>
		I've been a fan of brutal music since I was 12 because it can put me in a calming "wanna go to sleep" mood better than chill music.<br/>
		There are some few things I'm good at like brewing coffee, cooking, baking, and some people say my tiny hands give the best massage.<br/>
		I'm also good at playing volleyball and badminton.</p>
		
		<p>I was clinically diagnosed with clinical depresssion, ADHD and cyclothymic disorder at the age of 13.<br/>
		I've been taking meds for years now just to feel normal and just so I could sleep.<br/>
		I've had to study harder and twice as much just to get by with everyone and to get atleast the average.<br/>
		My ADHD gave me a superpower to learn tiny things quickly and making them my habits but I simply cannot do long division.</p>
		
		<p>I'm naturally a distant person, I was always that weird and geek kid in school from elementary to junior high school.<br/>
		I was extremely an introvert and i have my own little world. My classmates would say I'm such a loner. <br/>
		they don't know I chose to be alone, I prefer solitude. I prefer to shut myself out from the entire world.<br/>
		That's before meeting my coolest extrovert friends. I'm still an introvert but atleast I'm friends with<br/>
		these coolest and most sublime creature on earth who made my HS life crazy and exciting.</p>
		
		<p>Sometimes, I find myself doubting everthing I'm doing. I lose all the energy and motivation I had.<br/>
		There are times where I feel like a complete outcast.<br/>
		There are some days that i feel like  I'm not good at anything.<br/>
		There are also some days where I want to see myself growing. And between those days I've realized that,<br/>
		trying something new even when I'm not good at it, it will always make me grow.<br/>
		There are things I'm slacking in - good habits I want to create and bad habits I want to get rid<br/>
		and I'm fighting for things like more autonomy in the work I do about my self issues and a lots of baby steps.<br/>
		I think of myself right now  as a lady in a blindfold just walking where the whisper of my heart takes me.</p>
